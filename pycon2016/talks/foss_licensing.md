# What you need to know about Open Source Licensing (Felix Cruz)
* "I am not a lawyer. Biiig caviot."

# Copyright
* Protects creative, expressive works.
* Effectively copyright is forever.

# Moral Rights
* Non-commercial rights related to copyright.
* Right to attribution, integrity of the work.
* Vary a lot from country to country.
* Might not be automatic.
* Might last forever.
* might not be possible to waive or transfer.
* "Similar to how you can't agree to be murdered."

# Patents
* for protecting functional inventions.
* The deal: tell us how it works and you get exclusivity for a while.
* Beware of sneaky trolls and ambush.
* Some licenses protect you.
* "Design patent is not the same as a regular Patent."

# Trademarks

* For protection from fakes and imitations.
* Sort of automatic, but registration has power.
* Covers names, logos and identifiers like that.
* Still relevant to software projects.

# Licenseso
##Grant rights people wouldn't usually have:
* To use
* to modify
* to share

## create obligations:
* Attributions.
* share-alike (copyleft).
* Whatever shows up in a proprietary license.

# Permissive Licenses
* Let's developers do a lot including things like make proprietary products.
* Usually just require attribution and a warrenty disclaimer.
* "Just be sure you're ok with people making a lot of money off your code
without sharing any of it back."
* MIT / Expat / X111, ISC/n-clause BSD

* Apache 2.0 is a little different. Includes a grant of patent license.

# Grant of patent license
* Each contributor grants you a perpetual, no change, irrevocable patent
license to use the work. Applies only to those patent claims that are infringed
by their contributions. If you start a patent litigation then you open yourself
up to lose all of your patents.

# Copyleft Licenses
* Guarantee users freedom.
* prevent developers from restrictin or locking-in users.
* Require sharing derivatives the same way.
* Prevent building proprietary software.

# GPL2 vs Apache 2.0
* GPL2 and Apapche 2.0 are not compatible and will cause problems

# LGPL
* Virality aspect only applies to the original code that was licensed.
* "The idea is that even if you build a not free library ontop of an LGPL
license then the user can always choose to change the underlying LGPL code."

# AGPL
* "This is supposed to fix what's seen as a big 'loophole' in the GPL. This is
supposed to cover the case of networked code. Web applications that have users
which never get a distribution of the server code and as such they have no
rights under the GPL. AGPL makes it so that users that use your code in some
way recieve the same GPL rights."

# Public Domains
* "Remember 'Moral Rights?' Well it turns out that in many cases you can't give
up your moral rights. This means you can't push your software into the public
domain."
* "Remember that if you pick no license you aren't making a political statement
you're just making life harder for your fellow developers. Especially those
in countries not in the United States."

# Custom Licenses
* Please Don't.

# Non-software Licenses
* GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL)
* Creative Commons (BY, NC, ND, SA)

# Licensing Contributions
* Copyright assignemtn, don't, except for very good reaons.
* Contributor License agreement (CLA)
* The PSF one is fine to sign.
* Developer's Certification of Origin (DCO)

# Conclusions
* Pick a License
* That is already establised and in wide use
* That makes sense within your community
* that is appropriate to the nature of the work
* and that furthers your own goals.
