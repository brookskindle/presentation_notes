# Write An Excellent Programming Blog (Jesse Jiryu Davis)

# Why?
* Share your expertise
* "You know how to parse new york city subway schedules. I want you to write it
so I can learn form you."
* This let's your fellow specialists know about you.
* Writing is thinking. Writing the story about diagnosing a bug while you're
in the middle of the action helps you solve the bug.

# Not Finding The Time
* Story's need to contain some kind of return on investment.
* NOTE: read Glyph's unyielding.

# Opinions
* Don't go attacking people.
* "Karate is for defense only."
* NOTE: read more Julia Evans. Specifically "don't feel guilty about not contributing to open source."
* NOTE: read Kenneth Reitz "Growing Open Source Seeds."
* NOTE: Allison Kaptur "Of Syntax Warnings and Symbol Tables."

# Reviews
* If you are using some bit of technology consider reviewing it.
* A little bit dangerous
* "This is what it is. Here's it's strengths and weaknesses. In conclusion ..."

# How To Find Your Audience
* Your audiance will find you. SEO is made to help compete against other mass
media writers.
* That's the opposite of what you want to do in specialist writing.

# Make time for Writing
* Write shorter things.
* Reviews are naturally shorter.
* Try to write shortly after using something for the first time.

# Write Together
* Find your companies tech blogs and start writing for it.
