# Small artisanal bots (Elizabeth Uselton =D )

# Bots are a great advanced beginner project
* You need to learn about API's, OAuth, Virtual Machines, AWS, Background Tasks.

# Paragons of Botdom
* Just go watch her talk.

# OAuth
* This is where you should look
* "This looks likes computer garbage."

* Use the Twitter REST API rather than the streaming API.

# Twitter Permissions
* defaults to read only, change it to read-write.

# You Should Directly Work With the API Calls
* Just for the learning perspective.
* If you know API calls then use Tweepy.

# Civic Data
* Pros: It's all yours and there's so much!
* Cons: Weird formats, Often neglected.
* "Sometime's it's like rummaging through the bargin bin."

# Scaping Data
* "Works best on tables, on formatting data."
* Pros: Any data can be yours, Get new data automatically
* Cons: A little more work, people can change their website and you're boned.

* Amazong data sets
* Darius Kazemi
* Project Gutenberg

# Nature Language Toolkit
