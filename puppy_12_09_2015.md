# Understanding Future State In Machine Learning (Alice Zheng From Dato)
Microsoft research -> Dato
## The Machine Learning Pipeline
* Raw Data
* Features
* Models
* Deploy To Production
* Restart After Users react.

## Three Things About ML
* Feature = numeric representation of Data
* Model = Mathamatical "Summary" of features
* Making something that works = choose the right features to focus on.
## Representing natural text
* raw text
    * "It is a puppy and it is extremely cute."
    * For that sentance, what's important? Phrase? Specific words? Ordering? Subject, Verb, Noun?
    * The feature needs to be informative but that's really a human distinction.

## Going From Text To Numerics
* raw_text -> bag of words -> classify words and insert in vector.
* Side Tangent: There's two kinds of math books, those with pictures and those that are hard to understand.
* "Crudely speaking, mathemeticians fall into two categories: the algebraists,
who find it easiest to reduce all problems to reduce all problems to sets of
numbers and varialbes, and the geometers, who require things to be pictures and
shapes

## Visualizing a Sphere in 2D
* NOTE: need to figure out LaTex, start writing notes in IPython, and get to the
 point where I can in real time create shapes and designs. Or my notes need to 
 be on a tablet so I can write them and put drawings in my notes.

* FURTHER NOTE: I've gone from notebooks to electronics which have great benefits.
But I've lost the ability to draw my notes out. I need to figure out a system where
I can have both.

* x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2 = 1

##Why are we looking at Spheres?
* Apparently sphere's are homomorphic? Ponicare Conjecture.

## Visualizing Feature Engineer

## Improving Bag Of Words
* from BOW to tf-idf
* NOTE: I need to make a BOW and bag of lines script that can be targeted any file for all files in seastore01.
* NOTE: I want a histagram of all file names on seastore01.
* NOTE: I want a visualization of all tree structures on seastore01
* NOTE: I want a histagram of (file name, file size range) sorted by average size.
* PCA

## Apply PCA to Voting
* read yelp as csv
* gather all votes
* NOTE: IPython is seriously awesome for visualizing Data. Need to move away from markdown files.
* NOTE: Need to look up Juypter VIM plugin

# Overview of Taggers/Parsers
* Tagging every word [Fast]
* Parsing: Tagging and puts into Tree [Slow]
* Chunking: Gives pieces of tree [Medium]
* POSH Rules: Special fast and deep context aware [amazing]
* NOTE: look into chunking and POSH rules

## Tools to look up.
* NLTK
* PyStatParser
    * Builds a tree from a sentance. Specifically a NLTK tree instance.
* TextBlob
    * Easy for Parts of Speech.
* Clips Pattern
* Malt Parser
* spaCy
* NOTE: Presentations without points are spagetti presentations.
* Stanford Parser
    * Multiple languages and a web form.
* Pattern
    * really good for searching for things.

* NOTE: Really need to look up parts of speech.

## Word Graph Count
* "You don't need parts of speech to get 80% accuracy for machine learning."
* There's a real market for parts of speech libraries that aren't for english.
* NOTE: Holy SHIT JUYPTER INTERACTIVE GRAPHS.
* NOTE: Bag of words doesn't always work mainly because of word collisions.
* EXAMPLE: We can stop word collisions by looking at words as both their text
           and their part of speech.

## Prototyping a ML algorithm
* Machine Learning is a fundamentally human process. The ML algorithm will
depend on the data chosen which will be picked based on how a human feels about
that data.
* NOTE: Improvments in syntax are ones that reduce the total letter / word count
while keeping readability.
* NOTE: Really need to look into plotly.
