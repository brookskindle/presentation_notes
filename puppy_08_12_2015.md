#First Anniversity of Puppy
##Puppy Code of Conduct
#Timezones Suck (Patric O'man)
##Use UTC, not GMT
##Timezones in Python
* datetime.datetime.utcnow() #network times are different.
* datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat() is missing the Z at the end of the string.
* Use pytz (third party library)
* timeanddate.com
* Cron should keep pytz up to date.
#Awards
* Mike fortitude award (Never missing a PuPPy meetup)
* Contribution To Python Education (Chris Yuey)
    "Ok, you made a thing!"
* Peoples Choice Award(Karin Hutchenson)
#Name Things Once(Jack Diederich) @jackdied
##Naming Things Is Hard
* Be boring
* Be Precise
* You'll have to live with the choice
## Thinking About This Is Part Of Your Job
* Writing Code
* Code Reviews
* Searching For Code
* Deleting Cod
###gitub.com/jackdied/talks
##Framework For Naming
* "I tend to drink heavily and shout things at God."
* Who, what, when, were, why
* Who, When, Where, Why are metadata. Important to you as you wrote things.
* What is important to everyone else.
###Naming Perfection
* One Word isn't enough detail for context.
* Need to relearn English Grammatical Structure.
###Why Not Include Metadata
* Who doesn't tell someone if they need to use it.
* Where doesn't matter. It doesn't matter that the code was written in bostom.
* Machine destination doesn't really matter for a function name.
* All of this metadata doesn't matter for basic usage.
###Two Questions
* What is it
* WHat it does
* This means you don't even notice the name. They just work the way you expect them to.
###Users Have Context
* They imported your module
* They know what company they work for
###Example
from serverfactory.sfcli.commands.sf_command_benchmark
import SFBenchmarkCommand
* Project name four times
* Command Three times
* Benchmark twice
"Is it a loyalty test?"
### Take All Dots and Replace With Underscores
from serverfactory_sfcli_commands_sf_command_benchmark
* Remove duplicates.
###Terrible Ideas
* Funny Once. Jokes Are Terrible Names. Painful Forever.
* No Codenames. Meant to keep projects secret. You want people to use your project.
* Version Numbers and Names for the same project. Pick one.
##Questions
* "What's your view on acronyms?", "uuuh, no." "Hurts the new guy."
* "How does this relate to marketing names?" 
    "This talk only really applies to people that have limited their scope. So
    working at facebook means you can write something called "distributed_grep."
    This means that if you have a open source project and need your think to be
    googlable to the rest of the world then catchy names start to matter."
* "I have done the sin of naming something v2. Any advice for when you need both versions?"
    Use the word deprecated.
* "Be scared of problems linters can't yell at you for." - Jack Diederich
* "Be aware when you're starting to bucketize things. This is when you start including metadata in names" - Jack Diederich 
# All-singing All-Dancing Byte-Code (Larry Hastings)
* This Talk is about Python 3.5
## What Is Bytecode?
* Opcodes for Virtual Machines
* Stack Manipulations
* Flow Control Instructions
* Arithmetic Instructions
* Pythonic Instructions (Very Vague)
##When does Python Run Bytecode?
* All the time
* All Python programs can be translated to bytecode.
* Not all bytecode programs can be translated to Python Programs.
##Why have Bytecode?
* It seems like this is a extra level of complexity, why have this thing?
    Bytecode is a common technique used in many languages userd to lower complexity.
##Why Study Bytecode?
* Useful for core developers
* Knowing bytecode isn't required to be a great developer
* Some people hand tune Bytecode
* Granularity for GIL and threading
##Example

    def gunk(a=1, *args, b=3):
        print(args)
        c = None
        return (a + b, c)

##Dis
* First column is line number.
* Second Column is bytecode offset.
* Third column is the symbolic names of the bytecode
* Fourth is argument to bytecode, always unsigned 16-bit number
* Fifth column is a hint for what the argument is.
##Opcodes and HAVE_ARGUMENT
* 115 opcodes in python 3.5, up from 105 from python 3.4
* Opcodes are single bytes.

    bytecode = list(bytes) # really b""
    op =  bytecode[i]
    oparg = bytecode[i + 1] | (bytecode[i + 2] << 8)
    dis.HAVE_ARGUMENT = 90
    size = 1 if opcode < dis.HAVEARGUMENT else 3
##The VM
*Instruction pointer 
    ip(JUMP_)
    stack(LOAD_, STORE_,  ...)
    "fast locals" (LOAD_FAST, STORE_FAST)
##Stack Machine
    LOAD_x -> stack
    STORE_x <- stack #Symmetric operation

    BINARY_ADD
##Bytecode Variable Types
* Globals and builtins
    LOAD_GLOBALS

* "Fast Locals"
    LOAD_FAST

*Locals or "Slow Locals"
    LOAD_NAME

Consts
    LOAD_CONST

Object Attributes
    LOAD_ATTR

Cell
    LOAD_CELL, STORE_CELL
##Free And Cell Variables
    def foo():
    a = 1 # Local Variable
    b = 2 # Cell variable
    def bar():
        nonlocal b # free variable
        print(b)
##Data and Metadata
* `__code__` if you do type(func.`__code__`) you get <class 'code'>
##Why have a function object and why a code object?
* Code -> marshable
* function -> Not marshable
* And by marshable this means live marshable.
* `__code__` there for nested functions.
##`__code__.co_code`
   func.__code__.co_code # produces bytecode of the function.
## The Simplist Useful Disassembler
    import dis

    def disassemble(callable):
        print("def", callable.__name__ + ":")
        program = callable.__code__.co_code
        i = 0
## `__code__arguments` fields
    >>> func.__code__.co_argcount
    1
    >>> func
##Function Defaults
    >>> func.__defaults__
    (1,)
    >>> gunk.__kwdefaults__
    ("a": None)
    >>> gunk.__code__.co_names
    ("print", "None") # This None doesn't actually get used.
    # Actual None is in const table.
    (None,)
## Line Numbers
    >>> gunk.__code__.co_firstlineno
    1
    >>> gunk.__code__.co_lnotab
    b'\x00\x01\n\x01\x06\x01'
##More Metadata
* Functions carry global variables on their own back.
* Knows the name of it's own module and what file it's from
    >>> gunk.__code__.co_filename
* Really need to look at the `__code__` variable. Legitimitely useful for introspection.
##Advanced Topics
   >>> gunk.__annotations__
##Modules are callables
* Modules always return None
* You can deconstruct modules.
* `__qualname__` new in Python3
